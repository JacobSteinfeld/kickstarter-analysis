# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
The overall goal of this project was to examine different Kickstarter datasets and help gather information to help Louise, as she is getting close to her fundraising goal for her play, “Fever”. Louise has come close to her fundraising goal in a short amount of time and wants to know how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals.
## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
In order to gather the information Louise needs, we first had to break down the data of outcomes based on their launch date. The idea here was to see if there is any correlation between the time of year and the success of a play. We filtered the Kickstarter data to only show data for the plays, followed by finding the number of successful, failed, and canceled plays for every month.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
The idea for gathering data based on the goals of each play funded by Kickstarter was to split up the goals of the funding from least to most. We wanted to see the percentage of successful, failed, and canceled plays with respect to how much money the plays set their goals to.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
Some of the challenges encountered for me was getting the outcomes based on goals chart to look the way it does. I misunderstood what needed to be calculated, but after a few tries I was able to put it together.
## Results

- In conclusion, the results we got shows that plays that have a launch date around the summer time have a better chance of succeeding then they would any other time of year. April through July looks like the right time to launch a show.  As you can see, the “failed” and “canceled” lines in the graph are less effected by the time of release in comparison to the “successful” line. 

- Looking at the graph, it appears that the plays that had low goals ended up succeeded at a higher rate compared to the plays that had their goals much higher. In fact, 83% of plays that had a goal of 50000$ or higher failed. For the plays that had their goal under 4999$ ended up succeeding 73.47% of the time. We can conclude that plays with lower Kickstarter goals have a much better chance of succeeding than those who set their goal too high.

- Some of the limitations we faced in the outcomes and goals graph was not enough data to come to a strong conclusion in some aspects. For example, in the 45000-49999 goals range, there was only 1 play in there. It failed which made the fail rate 100%. Although the data did lean to a higher chance of failure if the goal was to high, it is hard to completely confirm the trend with such little data.

- A possible graph or chart that could have been useful would be to make a similar graph we did with the outcomes based on goals, but not filtering just plays. It would have been interesting to see if there was a trend within the whole dataset of success and the goal.
